### Web App for Dacha's :robot_face:

*"In this virtual interactive experience, audience contestants compete as they attempt to reprogram cutting-edge (but still buggy) AI chatbots to complete a series of reality-TV style challenges, with a winning prize for the “Most Human” bot on the show."*

**:robot_face:** was an original show initially put up late summer 2020 by Seattle based Dacha Theatre*, a theatre company specializing in devised, immersive, and playful work. I helped bring the zoom based reality show to life through my role as Creative Director and Engineer for a web app that would allow audience members who purchased contestant tickets to program AI actors with responses to interview input. This app includes both the portion the contestants see, where a programming assistant (actor) would coax them through filling out a grid with different modes and inputs that when taken together constituted how the AI would behave during the interview, but also the interface through which programming assistants spotlit the current firing code so the AI actors could focus on acting rather than parsing input.

This project's technical challenges mainly revolved around creating an interface that was easy for actor programming assistants to master (through shortcuts and dynamic error messages), clear for contestants to understand (consistent colors, a state machine graph of current mode setup), and efficient for AI communication (find and replacing mode initializations for activate commands). Helping to refine the tutorial and think about how to give the audience levers and control without overwhelming them was a fun game/interaction design challenge to take on on top of that (part of my Creative Direction hat!). Built in React.js and tweaked over the course of the shows rehearsal (and playtesting!) period.

*Fun fact I'm also a Dacha company member (2018 onward) and have done acting in their devised shows in the past! Check out their website at https://www.dachatheatre.com/about.html
